# To-Do App

A simple client-side task management app that leverages browser APIs for persistent state, minimal UI structure, and local storage. Itâ€™s designed with clean separation of logic and styling, without any external frameworks. Ideal as a boilerplate or starting point for local-only web apps.

## Key Techniques Used

* **[LocalStorage API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage)** for persistent task storage across sessions.
* **[Event.preventDefault()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/preventDefault)** to override form submission and handle custom logic.
* Dynamic DOM manipulation using **[document.createElement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/createElement)** and event binding with `onclick` handlers.
* **[CSS custom properties (variables)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*)** to manage theme consistency and easy updates.
* Conditional styling via JS by toggling visual state using classes and direct style changes (e.g., line-through for completed tasks).

## Libraries & External Resources

While there are no third-party JavaScript libraries, the following external resources are used:

* **[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)**:

  * [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat)
  * [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto)
  * [Inconsolata](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inconsolata)

## Project Structure

```
/CSS
/JS
index.html
```

* `/CSS`: Contains styling rules with a focus on custom properties, layout with flexbox, and UI transitions.
* `/JS`: Handles DOM updates, task logic, localStorage interactions, and event bindings.
* `index.html`: Links everything together and includes embedded form and layout structure.
